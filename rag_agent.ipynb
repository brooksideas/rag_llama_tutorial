The Canada Student Grants  also saw a 40% increase in funding.[11]\\nFreeland issued $15B of spending  cuts, achieved by defunding public services and cancelling\\npreviously announced programs.[12] A new tax 2% on stock buybacks  was also introduced.[11]Background\\nMeasures\\nHousing6/19/24, 1:59 PM 2023 Canadian federal budget - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_federal_budget 1/4', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2321, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
